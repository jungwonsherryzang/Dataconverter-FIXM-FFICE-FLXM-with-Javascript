# Dataconverter-FIXM-FFICE-with-typescript
Developing a data converter that converts XML to JSON and vice versa for an air traffic management dealing with flight data

## FIXM that stands for Flight Information eXchange Model is a data format for aviation flight information.
FIXM is a global exchange standard capturing Flight and Flow information.
FIXM is implemented in UML and XML and fully supports the data exchange requirements for the Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE) concept, as defined by the ICAO ATMRPP.

### FIXM consists of FIXM Applications, FIXM Core and FIXM Extensions.
FIXM Applications (Message Support) contains metadata about the message exchange in addition to guidance for constructing messages such as XML templates.
FIXM Core (Basic Flight Data) contains basic flight data that are globally applicable and which are endorsed by the FIXM CCB.
FIXM Extensions (Regional Supplements) supports localized requirements from particular communities of interest. It extends basic flight data and/or applications.
